# Catalyst Grid App

Simple Catalyst example (Mac idiom) of a grid-based app with a push/pop navigation stack. Includes back button in toolbar that auto-enables based on navigation status, and a window title that matches the navigated-to view controller.

Also demonstrates a mixed-style outline sidebar with collapsible sections, and a SwiftUI-based inspector panel that uses the wallpaper-hinted macOS window background color.
